#### What is a Direct Debit?

Direct Debit is a simple, safe and convenient way to manage your household bills or make regular or occasional payments from your bank account. You agree with the organisation the amount to be collected and the date of payment. From then on the amount will be deducted from your account as agreed. If they need to change the amount or collection date, they have to notify you first.

#### What is Modulus Checking?

Modulus checking is a procedure for applying a mathematical algorithm to an account number and sort code combination to check that it is valid. In the absence of an entire database of every bank account, it is the next best way of checking the likely validity of an account number. When combined with the ISCD it is highly effective at finding account number and sort code errors.

#### What is ISCD?

The Industry Sort Code Directory is a list of all UK financial institutions. The data contained relates to every bank in Britain, providing details such as address and telephone number. This information may be useful to the user should they have an incorrect sort code and wish to correct the error by finding the correct sort code, or perhaps simply to check the location of any given branch.

#### What is a profile?

A profile contains information about the data to be transmitted to Bacs for a service user. Each service user number can have many profiles. By using profiles one service user number can be used in a multitude of ways while constraining its full functionality. A profile will contain the users Bacs service user number, the bank account number and sort code they wish to perform transactions with and the location of the input file and filter to be applied to this file.

#### What is a transaction code?

Transaction codes are used to identify the type of financial transaction that should be applied to a specified bank account. To see a list of Bacs Transaction Codes click here.

#### What is AUDDIS?

AUDDIS (Automated Direct Debit Instruction Service) allows Direct Debit Instructions to be electronically transmitted between Direct Debit Originators (BacscomIP Users) and banks. A BacscomIP user simply sends a new Direct Debit Instruction via Bacs to the paying bank for acceptance. 

AUDDIS eliminates the need for BacscomIP users to send paper Direct Debit instructions to each bank and building society when processing a new Direct Debit. AUDDIS helps to reduce cost and result in a better quality service by allowing BacscomIP users personal control of Direct Debit Instructions. More importantly AUDDIS, reduces the time to set up a new Direct Debit Instruction. An AUDDIS Direct Debit instruction will be processed and active in 5 working days (inclusive) from the AUDDIS transmission date.
