Working days are based on English bank working days and exclude Saturdays, Sundays and Bacs Holidays. 

 * Day 1: Input day: payment files are submitted to Bacs
 * Day 2: Processing day: Bacs forward the payment instructions to the specified banks and building societies for processing  
 * Day 3: Entry day: payment instructions are applied by the banks and building societies

## Bacs Service Opening Times 

There are two service windows for Bacstel-IP during which different parts of the service are available. The two service windows are: 

 1. Submissions window 
 1. Bacs payment services window 

### Submissions window 

The Submissions window is available from 07:00 hours every Monday morning until 22:30 hours every Friday evening excluding Bacs holidays. Live submissions can be made at any time during this period. 

All submissions that complete their transmission by 22:30 hours will be input for the current day. Any transmissions completed after 22:30 hours will not be input until the next valid input day. For example if a file is transmitted on Friday 22:31 hours the next valid input day would usually be the following Monday unless it is a Bacs  holiday in which case the next valid input day would be the following Tuesday. 

### Bacs payment services window 

The Bacs Payment Services window is usually open from 07:00 hours on Monday until 23:00 hours on Friday excluding Bacs holidays, and is subject to change.  Please refer to the Bacs Service User Guide for further information on Bacs opening times and Bacs Payment Services. 

## Submission Types 

Bacs accepts files of various submission types e.g. Structural Test, Full Test or Live.  

### Submission definitions: 

 * **Structural Test:** A basic test to check the structure of the payment file is acceptable to Bacs 
 * **Full Test:** The payment file goes through full validation with Bacs and the Banks. 
 * **Live:** The Submission status where the payment file instructions are implemented and money is moved. **THIS IS NOT A TEST MODE - THE INSTRUCTIONS ARE ACTIVE AND WILL BE COLLECTED**

The submission type is displayed on the Bacs Transmission Form prior to submitting a file to Bacs.
